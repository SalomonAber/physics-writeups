\subsection{Method}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Connect the loudspeaker to the \SI{4}{\ohm} output of the signal generator.
  \item Set the signal generator to the \SI{100}{\hertz} - \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz} range, with the output turned
down.
  \item Adjust the water level in the tube so that it is between \SI{20}{\centi\metre} and \SI{40}{\centi\metre} from the top.
  \item Set the frequency to 300 Hz and increase the output until you can just hear the note.
  \item By lowering the funnel, allow the water level to drop, and listen carefully. You should hear
the note suddenly get louder and then fainter as the water level passes through the
resonance position.
  \item Measure the distance, $l_1$, from the top of the tube to the resonance position. Now allow
the water level to drop and find a second resonance position, $l_1$.
  \item Repeat for different frequencies between \SI{300}{\hertz} and \SI{600}{\hertz}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}
The wavelength column was caclulated using the formula:
\begin{equation*}
  c = f \cdot \lambda
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  c= f \cdot 2 \cdot (l_2-l_1)
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Analysis}
The average speed was \SI{331.85}{\metre\per\second}. The true speed of sound was calculated to be \SI{344.08}{\hertz} using the following equation with t as \SI{22}{\celsius}:
\begin{equation*}
  c = 331 \sqrt{1 + \frac{t}{273}}
\end{equation*}

The percentage difference between the true and calculated speed of sound was:
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{344.08-331.85}{344} \cdot 100 = 3.55 \%
\end{equation*}

The uncertainty in our speed of sound was:
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{0.1}{13} \cdot 100 \cdot 2 = 1.54\%
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Evaluation}
As $1.54<3.55$ our results are not accurate.
The main reason for this is that there was systematic error in our measurements of $l_1$ and $l_2$.
This was because we left a gap between the speaker and tube and did not account for this in our calculations.
Another reason could be that as we left a gap between the speaker and tube, not all the sound was directed down the tube.
